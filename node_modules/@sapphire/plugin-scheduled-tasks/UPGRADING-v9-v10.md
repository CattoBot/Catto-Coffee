# Migration guide for @sapphire/plugin-scheduled-tasks v9.x to v10.x

## Task payloads

### Enforcing types

The `ScheduledTaskJob` interface has been removed in favor of defining types on `ScheduledTasks`.

You can define a payload type for a task by using module augmentation on `ScheduledTasks`. If the value of the entry is set to `never` or `undefined` in the interface, then there is no payload required for the task. If the type union contains an `undefined`, then the payload will be optional. Otherise, it will enforce the provided type for that task. Below are some examples.

```ts
declare module '@sapphire/plugin-scheduled-tasks' {
	interface ScheduledTasks {
		[ExampleTasks.One]: { data: string } | null;
		[ExampleTasks.Two]: never;
		[ExampleTasks.Three]: boolean | undefined;
	}
}

/** ExampleTasks.One */

// Good
await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.One, payload: { data: 'value' } });

await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.One, payload: null });

// Type error
await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.One, payload: { data: true } });

await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.One, payload: false });

/** ExampleTasks.Two */

// Good
await container.tasks.create(ExampleTasks.Two);

await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.Two });

// Type error
await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.Two, payload: null });

/** ExampleTasks.Three */

// Good
await container.tasks.create(ExampleTasks.Three);

await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.Three });

await container.tasks.create({ name: ExampleTasks.Three, payload: true });
```

## Task handler

### Internal client

Due to the removal of `ScheduledTaskJob`, the `BullClient` will now be typed as `unknown` since the Job types in the Queue can not _really_ be known. So you will need to do validation when interacting directly with the client.

## Error listeners

The included error listeners are now enabled by default. If you want them to be disabled, just set `loadScheduledTaskErrorListeners` to false in the `SapphireClient` options.

### Error handling

The internal BullMQ client does not actually throw any errors, it just emits them from the client. As such, those error events will now be sent to the corresponding error listener registered by the plugin.

### Error payload types

The error listeners previously only returned the name of the task when an error was emitted, but now the event will provide the associated Piece.

## BullMQ v5

The BullMQ dependency is being updated to v5 from v3. If you depend on the internal BullMQ client in any way, check out their releases for breaking changes.

### Required `tasks` client property

The `tasks` property for options relating to this plugin are now required. They were previously optional which was an oversight, as a connection string is always needed.
