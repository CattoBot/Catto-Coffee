-   Fully tested

## Installation

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/timer-manager
```

## Usage

**Note:** While this section uses `require`, the imports match 1:1 with ESM imports. For example `const { TimerManager } = require('@sapphire/timer-manager')` equals `import { TimerManager } from '@sapphire/timer-manager'`.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Import the TimerManager class
const { TimerManager } = require('@sapphire/timer-manager');

// Use the class for timeouts
const timeout = TimerManager.setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello, world!'), 1000);
TimerManager.clearTimeout(timeout);

// Use the class for intervals
const interval = TimerManager.setInterval(() => console.log('Hello, world!'), 1000);
TimerManager.clearInterval(interval);

// Destroy all running timeouts and intervals so that NodeJS can gracefully exit
TimerManager.destroy();
```
