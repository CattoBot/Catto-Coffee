## Description

Sometimes there is a need to know what a value's type of something is, this package exists to satisfy those needs by
implementing a parser that can retrieve the type of the value recursively and process a string similar to TypeScript's
types.

## Features

- Written in TypeScript
- Bundled with Rollup so it can be used in NodeJS and browsers
- Offers CommonJS, ESM and UMD bundles
- Fully tested

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @sapphire/type
# npm install @sapphire/type
```

## Usage

**Note:** While this section uses `require`, the imports match 1:1 with ESM imports. For example
`const { Type } = require('@sapphire/type')` equals `import { Type } from '@sapphire/type'`.

**Note:** When using ESM syntax you can also default-import `Type` class: `import Type from '@sapphire/type'`.

**Note:** The internal functions of `getPromiseDetails` and `getProxyDetails` are also exported. If you don't know what
these are, then you need not be concerned about this.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Import the Type class
const { Type } = require('@sapphire/type');

// Define a Type with an array of two numbers
const type = new Type([1, 2]);

console.log(type.toString());
// Logs: Array<number>
```
