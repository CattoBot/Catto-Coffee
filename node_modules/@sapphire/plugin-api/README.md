## Description

This plugin provides an API endpoint for your bot that can be called from external services. A good exemplary use case for this is once your bot grows to have enough configuration options that you want to offer a website to your end-users to change those settings, and your website needs to interface with the bot for this to work.

## Features

-   Fully ready for TypeScript!
-   Follows common REST standards.
-   Includes ESM ready entrypoint
-   Premade OAuth 2.0 endpoints

## Installation

`@sapphire/plugin-api` depends on the following packages. Be sure to install these along with this package!

-   [`@sapphire/framework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/framework)
-   [`discord.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
-   [`discord-api-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-api-types)

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh

```

## Usage

Start by importing the registration file in your project to use the plugin:

**JavaScript**

```js
require('@sapphire/plugin-api/register');
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import '@sapphire/plugin-api/register';
```

Then, you can use the following configuration options in your SapphireClient extension class or initializer. This will either be located in your `new SapphireClient` constructor call, or `super` in your constructor method if you use an extension class.

```js
{
  auth: {
	// The application/client ID of your bot.
	// You can find this at https://discord.com/developers/applications
    id: '',
	// The client secret of your bot.
	// You can find this at https://discord.com/developers/applications
    secret: '',
	// The name of the authentication cookie.
    cookie: 'SAPPHIRE_AUTH',
	// The URL that users should be redirected to after a successful authentication
    redirect: '',
	// The scopes that should be given to the authentication.
    scopes: [OAuth2Scopes.Identify],
	// Transformers to transform the raw data from Discord to a different structure.
    transformers: []
  },
  // The prefix for all routes, e.g. / or v1/.
  prefix: '',
  // The origin header to be set on every request at 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
  origin: '*',
  // Any options passed to the NodeJS "net" internal server.listen function
  // See https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_options_callback
  listenOptions: {
	// The port the API will listen on.
    port: 4000
  }
}
```
