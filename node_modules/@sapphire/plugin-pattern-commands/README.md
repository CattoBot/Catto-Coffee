## Description

With pattern commands you can define rulesets to which the bot may respond.

## Important notes

-   Starting August 31, 2022 this plugin will only work with Message Intent. This is because this plugin relies on scanning messages, which is impossible without the intent.

## Features

-   Fully ready for TypeScript!
-   Includes ESM ready entrypoint
-   Type generics for easy extension in TypeScript
-   Input/Output mapping

## Installation

`@sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands` depends on the following packages. Be sure to install these along with this package!

-   [`@sapphire/framework`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/framework)
-   [`@sapphire/utilities`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/utilities)
-   [`@sapphire/stopwatch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sapphire/stopwatch)
-   [`discord.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands @sapphire/framework @sapphire/utilities @sapphire/stopwatch discord.js
```

---

## Usage

-   Paste this in your Bot.ts (or where you initiate your client)

```typescript
import '@sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands/register';
```

-   Create a new `pattern-commands` directory under `/src`
-   Make your first pattern command:

```typescript
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';
import { PatternCommand } from '@sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands';
import { ApplyOptions } from '@sapphire/decorators';

@ApplyOptions<PatternCommand.Options>({
	aliases: ['cat', 'postman'],
	chance: 85
})
export class AwooCommand extends PatternCommand {
	public messageRun(message: Message) {
		message.reply('Woof!');
	}
}
```

In this example there's a 85% chance when your bot will bark at someone who says cat or postman.
The matcher is case-insensitive and can match at substrings as well (so in the example above the word catnip also can trigger your bot)
For aliases you can use regexp as well, but you have to encapsulate them as a string. For example:

```typescript
@ApplyOptions<PatternCommand.Options>({
    aliases: ['a{3,}'],
})
```
