## Description

Node has a great global `fetch` (powered by [undici]) for making API calls, but because it focuses solely on bringing the [Fetch API][fetch-mdn] to Node.js, it doesn't provide specific error messages and handling for different return types (JSON, Buffer, plain text, etc). This is where `@sapphire/fetch` comes in. The syntax is more restrictive than that of [undici], but that makes it consistent and easier to use in TypeScript.

## Features

-   Written in TypeScript
-   Fully tested
-   Exported `enum` for the common return data types
-   Throws distinctive errors when the API returns a "not ok" status code to make them easier to understand
-   Enforces casting the return type when requesting JSON data, to ensure your return data is strictly typed
-   Uses global `fetch`, which for NodeJS is [undici] and for browsers is the [Fetch API][fetch-mdn]

## Installation

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```sh
npm install @sapphire/fetch
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> While this section uses `import`, it maps 1:1 with CommonJS' require syntax. For example,
>
> ```ts
> import { fetch } from '@sapphire/fetch';
> ```
>
> is the same as
>
> ```ts
> const { fetch } = require('@sapphire/fetch');
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When providing a serializable object to the `body` option, `@sapphire/fetch` will automatically call `JSON.stringify` on the object. This means you can pass an object directly to the `body` option without having to call `JSON.stringify` yourself.
> If the body is _not_ serializable (such as a `File`, `Buffer`, or `Blob`), the body will be sent as-is.
> Serializability is calculated based on:
>
> -   If the body is `null`
> -   If the body's `.constructor` property is `undefined`
> -   If the body's `.constructor.name` property is `Object`
> -   If the body has a function property named `toJSON`

> [!WARNING]
> Because `@sapphire/fetch` aims to be as close to global fetch as possible, it doesn't support proxy options that a library like undici does. If you want to use a proxy, you should use undici directly.

### `GET`ting JSON data

```typescript
// Import the fetch function
import { fetch, FetchResultTypes } from '@sapphire/fetch';

interface JsonPlaceholderResponse {
	userId: number;
	id: number;
	title: string;
	completed: boolean;
}

// Fetch the data. No need to call `.json()` after making the request!
const data = await fetch<JsonPlaceholderResponse>('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', FetchResultTypes.JSON);

// Do something with the data
console.log(data.userId);
```

### `GET`ting Buffer data (images, etc.)

```typescript
// Import the fetch function
import { fetch, FetchResultTypes } from '@sapphire/fetch';

// Fetch the data. No need to call `.buffer()` after making the request!
const sapphireLogo = await fetch('https://github.com/sapphiredev.png', FetchResultTypes.Buffer);

// sapphireLogo is the `Buffer` of the image
console.log(sapphireLogo);
```

### `POST`ing JSON data

```typescript
// Import the fetch function
import { fetch, FetchResultTypes, FetchMethods } from '@sapphire/fetch';

// Post the data. No need to call `.json()` after making the request!
const responseData = await fetch(
	'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos',
	{
		method: FetchMethods.Post,
		headers: {
			'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		},
		body: { name: 'John Doe' }
	},
	FetchResultTypes.JSON
);

// Do something with the response data
console.log(responseData);
```
